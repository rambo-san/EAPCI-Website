      <p class="text-lg sm:text-xl md:text-2xl leading-relaxed mb-8">
        EAPCI was established in 2010 by Counseling and Clinical psychologists from Uganda and Kenya after realizing that both countries share similar psychosocial challenges. A unique experiential learning methodology is applied in all courses and has been found to be very effective. The shared vision of founders was realized when they established an institute in Uganda which has been steadily progressing over the past 13 years. EAPCI is a professional counseling institute registered with the Registrar of Companies (number 119844) in Uganda.
